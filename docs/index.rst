brickalize Documentation
========================

**brickalize** is a Python package for converting 3D models (STL) into LEGO-like brick structures, generating necessary support structures, and visualizing the result in 3D or as layer-by-layer 2D images.

It allows you to take a standard 3D model file and transform it into a representation made of LEGO-like bricks, suitable for physical building or further digital manipulation.
